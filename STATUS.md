# 🌿 Lil Blunt: The Smoke Realm — Live Status Report

**Play it (primary):** https://youngstunners88.itch.io/lil-blunt-adventure
**Mirror:** https://lil-blunt-game.vercel.app
**Branch:** `claude/setup-game-dev-environment-itWJv` · **PR #2**

> This report is updated, committed, and pushed on every change so you always
> have something current to look at. Last updated: **2026-07-12**.

## ✅ itch.io setup complete on your side — deploy in flight

You created the page and added `BUTLER_API_KEY` — both verified. The first
automated deploy attempt (manual trigger) was stopped by the secret scanner
doing its job (see security notice below — findings were in old git history,
not the game). The current push redeploys automatically; the game page goes
live with this build.

## 🎨 Art status

- **Backgrounds:** purpose-made client environments — GM Forest, Crystal
  Caves, Gold Mine interior, FOMO boss arena. DONE.
- **Lil Blunt:** REAL pixel-art sprites in-game — cowboy (L1/L3), miner &
  crystal outfits (L2), auto-swapped per level. DONE this update.
- **Bosses:** real sprites — IRS Tax Collector, Crystalline Bureaucrat,
  Bandit mine-cart. DONE this update.
- **Enemies / collectibles:** REAL AI-generated pixel sprites in-game — Tax
  Collector minion, fly, boulder, hostile vine, coin, ETH ring, GOLD nugget,
  Diamond shard. DONE this update (generated via Muapi/Flux, bg-removed,
  downscaled to game size).
- **New items:** Purple Weed power-up plant, Pickaxe & Torch tools — all with
  real sprites, placed in all 3 levels.

## 🚨 SECURITY NOTICE (action needed — 5 minutes, urgent)

CI's new secret scanner caught something real: the very first commit of this
repo (a March "workspace backup", before the game existed) included old
trading-bot scripts with **two Ethereum private keys** — and this repo is
**public**. The files were deleted long ago, but git history keeps everything.
**Treat both wallets as compromised**: if either address still holds funds,
move them now to a wallet whose key was never in this repo —
`0x0089...56F0` and `0x3713...4201` (full addresses in
`docs/security/audit-log.md`). Then tell me and I'll scrub them from git
history (needs your OK — it rewrites all branches). Day-to-day builds are
NOT blocked; details in the audit log.

## 🔧 Known gaps → next up (priority order)

1. **Full walk/jump frame animation** for Lil Blunt (a procedural run-bob +
   jump stretch ships now; hand-drawn frames still welcome).
2. **Level design depth** — more platforming, secrets, reasons to explore.
3. **SFX pass** — music is IN (12 tracks); jump/coin/damage sounds still placeholder.
4. **Weed Leaf + Magic Mushroom sprites** (the last two placeholder squares).

## 🌐 Hosting: moved to itch.io (root cause of "sometimes doesn't play" found)

The intermittent boot failures were traced to the web export's **threaded
mode**, which requires SharedArrayBuffer — a browser feature that silently
fails without special server headers, in many iframes, and on some mobile
browsers. Fixes shipped:

- Export switched to **non-threaded** — boots everywhere, no special headers,
  no more silent failures.
- **itch.io is now the primary platform** — game-native CDN (no cold starts),
  built-in discovery/analytics, and 90M+ players/month. Vercel stays as a mirror.
- CI now auto-packages an itch-ready zip **and auto-deploys via butler**
  (itch.io's official CLI) once the `BUTLER_API_KEY` secret is added.

## 🗓 Changelog (newest first)

- **2026-07-12 (feel pass + security incident)** — GAMEPLAY FEEL PASS: the
  game finally *feels* like a 16-bit platformer, not a physics demo.
  - **Jump arc**: falls 1.65× faster than it rises (same jump height, ~12%
    less airtime) — the classic snappy arc. Terminal velocity added.
  - **Run**: proper acceleration ramp (~0.1s to full speed) and crisp stops,
    replacing instant start/stop. Dash, knockback, and wall-jump momentum now
    carry and bleed off naturally instead of vanishing after one frame.
  - **Forgiveness**: coyote time up to 6 frames, jump buffer to 0.12s.
  - **Camera lookahead**: the view leads the direction you're moving (±56px)
    and peeks down during fast falls — you see where you're going.
  - **Impact**: hits now have hitstop (70ms freeze-frame) + stronger
    knockback; hard landings squash (that animation existed but was never
    wired); air dash is 2× run speed and flattens your arc — an actual move.
  - Full numbers + rationale: `docs/architecture/adr-gameplay-feel.md`.
  - **SECURITY**: gitleaks (added last audit) caught two real Ethereum
    private keys in pre-game git history from a March workspace-backup
    commit — repo is public, keys are burned. Owner notified (see notice
    above), incident logged in `docs/security/audit-log.md`, wasm false
    positives allowlisted via `.gitleaks.toml`, history scrub pending
    owner approval.

- **2026-07-12 (itch key)** — itch.io API key added to the environment and
  verified live: authenticated successfully as `youngstunners88`, downloaded
  + SHA-256-verified butler 15.28.0, attempted a real push of the current
  build. Blocked only by the game page not existing yet (`invalid game` —
  itch.io requires the page to be created via their web UI first, no API for
  it). Everything else in the pipeline is proven end-to-end and ready to fire
  the instant the page exists — see the action-needed section above.
- **2026-07-12 (security)** — SECURITY CHECKLIST ADAPTED + AUTOMATED: took the
  general "vibe-coded SaaS app" security checklist you provided and rewrote
  it against what this game actually is (client-only static Godot export, no
  backend/DB/accounts/payments) — see `docs/security/GAME_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`.
  Ran the first audit (`docs/security/audit-log.md`): all real checks PASS
  (no leaked secrets, DEMO wallet labeling intact, no hardcoded addresses,
  non-threaded export intact, postMessage origin-checked). Found and fixed
  one gap: CI had no secret-scanner, now runs `gitleaks` on every push and
  fails the build on any finding. Found one open item needing a human with
  Vercel access: the live mirror is missing 3 headers (CSP, nosniff,
  referrer-policy) that are defined in `vercel.json` but not appearing on the
  live response — likely a stale deploy. **This audit now runs automatically,
  unprompted, on every `/release-game`** (Step 1/6) — it blocks the release
  if secrets leak, a real wallet address gets hardcoded, or the threaded-export
  bug regresses. No need to ask for a security check going forward.
- **2026-07-12 (music)** — REAL MUSIC IN-GAME: your 12 tracks wired with a
  shuffle system — every stage cycles its two songs at random (never the same
  one twice in a row), every boss fight has its own two-song rotation, and
  the final boss (Bandit, Level 3) gets its dedicated pair. Blaze/Purple
  power-ups now hit with the fresh-boost jingle. Also hardened CI against a
  push race that failed one export run.
- **2026-07-12 (later)** — ART PASS + TOOLS & PURPLE POWER (GitHub access
  restored — all queued work is pushed):
  - **11 real sprites generated** (Muapi/Flux, 16-bit style, transparent,
    game-sized) and wired in: Tax Collector minion, fly, boulder, hostile
    vine, coin, ETH ring, GOLD nugget, Diamond shard, purple weed plant,
    pickaxe, torch. Placeholder squares for enemies/collectibles are GONE.
  - **NEW: Purple Weed power-up** — the flagship strain: faster + higher than
    Blaze Mode, rapid auto-puffs, royal purple glow (15s). In all 3 levels.
  - **NEW: Tools Lil Blunt can carry** — Pickaxe (smashes boulders, breaks
    blocks by walking into them, 2× GOLD mining yield) and Torch (heat aura
    damages nearby enemies, warm glow — made for Crystal Caverns). Tool shows
    in his hand while active.
  - **Run animation** — procedural run-bob + existing jump stretch/land
    squash; walking finally reads as motion, not a sliding statue.
  - Vine hitbox now matches its visual (used to hit below while drawn above).
- **2026-07-12** — SECURITY + STABILITY SWEEP (specialist audit, bug hunt,
  stress test):
  - **Stress test built & passed** (`scripts/stress-game.mjs`): 45s random
    input mashing, 40 rapid pause toggles, 45s travel soak — zero crashes,
    zero errors, memory flat at ~45MB (no leaks).
  - **Security audit (10 findings, all addressed or accepted)**: fake
    "wallet connected / TX submitted" flow relabeled to explicit DEMO mode
    (no fake tx hashes — real-brand trust risk); postMessage origin checks
    both directions (launcher + game); CI supply chain pinned (butler 15.28.0
    + SHA-256, Godot verified against official SHA-512 sums); CSP +
    nosniff + referrer headers added to the mirror.
  - **5 gameplay bugs fixed** (from crash-hunt): HUD showing stale hearts
    after every level change; player death during boss victory soft-locking
    the game to main menu; scene-load failure permanently freezing the
    session (now recovers); wBTC/GOLD double-collection exploit; mine cart
    fast/slow types never applying (day-88/day-288 economy was dead code).
  - **HUD glyph fix**: emoji icons (tofu boxes on web) replaced with real
    heart pips + text labels — HUD is finally readable in production.
- **2026-07-11** — Verification harness PROVEN against the real game: headless
  Chromium now boots the build, clicks PLAY LEVEL 1, and screenshots live
  gameplay (Lil Blunt + HUD + GM Forest — evidence in `game-verify-level.png`).
  Hardened `scripts/verify-game.mjs` (real boot detection — a splash screen no
  longer counts as a pass; WebGL/SwiftShader flags; benign-warning filtering).
  Fixed audio error spam (`audio_manager.gd` now skips missing placeholder
  tracks). GitHub push still blocked (403) — commits queued locally.
- **2026-07-10** — itch.io migration: root-caused intermittent boot failures
  (threaded export → SharedArrayBuffer dependency), switched to non-threaded
  export, built full itch.io pipeline (CI butler auto-deploy + itch-ready zip
  artifact + `scripts/deploy_itch.sh`), new `/itch-deploy` skill. Awaiting
  owner's itch.io page + `BUTLER_API_KEY` secret to go live.
- **2026-07-09 (verified+live)** — Sprite build browser-verified (cowboy Lil
  Blunt standing on GM Forest platforms, 0 errors), deployed to production,
  and **merged to master** — the repo homepage now shows the full project.
- **2026-07-09 (later)** — REAL CHARACTER ART IN-GAME: client sprites wired
  for Lil Blunt (cowboy/miner/crystal outfits, per-level swap, feet-aligned)
  and all bosses (Tax Collector, Crystalline Bureaucrat, Bandit cart).
  Purpose-made environments replace cropped backdrops. New /sprite-pipeline
  skill. Rules added: keep master current + model advice each response.

- **2026-07-09** — Real painted backdrops from client key art wired into all 3
  levels + boss arenas; platforms restyled to read over art; key art archived
  in `assets/keyart/`. Living STATUS report + always-push rule added.
  **Browser-verified (GM Forest renders, 0 errors) + deployed to production.**
  Remaining eyesore now = enemies/coins/character are still small shapes over
  the art — that's the next sprite pass (needs image-gen key or supplied PNGs).
- **2026-07-08** — Fixed 5 layered defects that made the game unplayable
  (boot, 8 parse errors, missing input map, black-screen scene load, empty
  level data). Added browser verification harness + `/game-graphics`,
  `/playtest-web`, `/export-deploy` skills.
